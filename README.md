# NightyNight #

## Introduction ##

An ESP8266 based, WS2812 night light with wifi based (web) configuration and
MQTT control.

Like PixelBall ( [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/krayon/pixelball) /
[Github](https://github.com/krayon/pixelball) ) on steroids. Whilst PixelBall
is simple and pre-programmed, NightyNight allows for initial setup to be done
via a web interface, accessible by connecting to it, whilst it runs as a WiFi
access point. Once configured, it connects to an MQTT server and accepts
commands.

Designed as a Night Light for my Son.
